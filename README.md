# nlp_tokenazation_LogisticRegression-test
#one line summary
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sentence or text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are usually individual words, but they can also be characters or phrases depending on the analysis.

#overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews from a women’s clothing e-commerce dataset.
The goal is to automatically understand customer opinions and classify reviews as Positive or Negative, helping businesses gain actionable insights without manually reading thousands of reviews.

#Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms receive massive amounts of customer feedback daily.
Manually analyzing these reviews is:
Time-consuming
Subjective
Not scalable
This project builds an AI-based sentiment analysis system that automatically predicts how customers feel about products, enabling data-driven business decisions.
The dataset contains real customer reviews and metadata about clothing products.

Features:

Clothing ID – Unique identifier of the product
Age – Reviewer’s age
Title – Review title
Review Text – Customer’s written feedback
Rating – Score from 1 to 5
Recommended IND – Whether customer recommends the product
Positive Feedback Count – Helpful votes received
Division Name – Product division (General, Petite, etc.)

Department Name – Category (Dresses, Tops, etc.)

Class Name – Specific clothing class
Target Variable Created:

Sentiment

Rating 4–5 → Positive

Rating 1–2 → Negative

Rating 3 → Removed (Neutral)

⚙️ Methodology

1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Checked structure using .head() and .info()
2️⃣ Text Preprocessing

Performed:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation

Stopword removal

Tokenization

Lemmatization

Created new column → clean_reviews
3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Converted text into numerical features using:

TF-IDF Vectorization

4️⃣ Model Training

Trained multiple classifiers:

Logistic Regression (Baseline)

Naive Bayes (Best for text)

Random Forest (Comparison)
5️⃣ Transformer-Based Prediction

Used pre-trained model:

distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english


to predict sentiment and confidence scores.
6️⃣ Model Evaluation

Compared predictions with actual ratings using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score
Key Insights from Analysis

Most customers expressed positive sentiment, indicating good product satisfaction.

Words like “comfortable”, “fit”, “love” appeared frequently in positive reviews.

Negative reviews often mentioned:

Size issues

Fabric quality

Poor fit

Younger customers (20–30 age group) provided more positive feedback.

Certain product categories (e.g., dresses) had consistently better sentiment scores.
🤖 Model Output
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	~82%
Naive Bayes	~84%
Random Forest	~80%
Hugging Face Transformer	~85%

Transformer model performed best because it understands context, not just keywords.
💻 Sample Code Snippet
Text Cleaning
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', str(text))
    words = text.split()
    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in words if w not in stopwords.words('english')]
    return " ".join(words)

df['clean_reviews'] = df['Review Text'].apply(clean_text)

TF-IDF Vectorization
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['clean_reviews'])

Logistic Regression Model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Hugging Face Prediction
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier("This dress is amazing!")

▶️ How to Run This Project
Step 1: Install Requirements
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk transformers

Step 2: Download NLTK Data
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

Step 3: Run Notebook

Open:

Jupyter Notebook → sentiment_analysis.ipynb


Then run all cells sequentially.

📈 Results

The model successfully automated sentiment detection and aligned closely with customer ratings.
It demonstrated that AI can effectively summarize customer opinion at scale.

✅ Conclusion

This project shows how NLP can transform unstructured review text into meaningful business intelligence.
Companies can automatically track customer satisfaction, identify product issues, and improve decision-making.

🔮 Future Work

Train a domain-specific fashion sentiment model

Include neutral sentiment instead of removing it

Apply Topic Modeling (LDA) to discover hidden issues

Build a real-time dashboard for monitoring customer feedback

Deploy model as an API for live review analysis
